# filmoteket

An old project about films and film festivals using TMDB API.
Films you say, mm, yes according to urban dictionary: "When it's art, you call it a film. When it's mainstream garbage, it's called a movie." Haha.

For now just dumping everything here.. to be refactored.

to check it out:
have a locally run mongodb for signup/login etc
it's a plus if you have a tmdb Apikey.. to get the search functionality work. 

npm install
npm run dev
